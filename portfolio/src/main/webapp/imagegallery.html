      <p>When I was younger, I did not see the appeal of taking pictures because I was worried about them taking up too much space on my 8 GB iPod. As a result, I don't have many pictures of
        myself or others until freshman year of high school (when I upgraded to an iPhone 6S).
      <p>But now, I enjoy taking pictures. Pictures provide a sense of nostalgia for me when I look back at them years down the road. They serve as a memento of what life was back then,
        and even can serve as a message to reach out to an old friend I haven't talked to in years. It's not about how great the picture is, but how great the moment during the picture was.
      <p>Here are a few of my favorite photos I've taken throughout my life:</p>
