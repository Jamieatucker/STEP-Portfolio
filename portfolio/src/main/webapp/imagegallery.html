            <p>When I was younger, I did not see the appeal of taking pictures because I was worried about them taking up too much space on my 8 GB iPod. As a result, I don't have many pictures of
                myself or others until freshman year of high school (when I upgraded to an iPhone 6S.)
            <p>Here are a few of my favorite photos I've taken throughout my life.</p>
