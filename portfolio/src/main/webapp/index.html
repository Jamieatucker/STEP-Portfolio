        <p>Hello! My name is Jamie Tucker (Pronouns: he/him/his) and I am a rising Sophomore at The Ohio State University.
          I'm currently majoring in Computer Science Engineering, 
          learning the necessary skills to become a software engineer.
        <p>I've been coding since middle school, starting with drag and drop
          programs such as Scratch. I built a couple of game projects at various
          summer camps and even a dance video!
          As I got older, I experimented with other coding websites, such as Khan Academy and Codecademy,
          to learn the basics of Java.
          During my Junior year of high school, I enrolled into a tech campus called Oakland Schools Technical Campus (OSTC),
          where I learned to build websites using HTML and CSS.
          This tech campus sparked my passion to pursue a career in Computer Science with
          their interactive engagement, fun projects, and overall supportive staff.
        <p> Below are a few projects that I've built:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Pacific Trails Resort Website (OSTC, September 2017)
          <li>Pokemon Battle Simulator (OSTC, May 2018)
          <li>Stickman: On The Run Video Game (Freelance Camp, August 2018)
          <li>Financial Literacy Simulator (OSU Hackathon, November 2019)
          <li>Text-Based Hang Man (Personal Project, May 2020)</b>
        </ul>

        <p>When I'm not coding, I love to watch sports, play video games, and exercise at the gym.
          I specifically love watching football and basketball (whether its college or professional).
          Whenever the big game is on, I'm glued to the TV, watching all of the glorious action taking place.
          My favorite sports teams are the Detroit Lions, Portland Trail Blazers, 
          and the Golden State Warriors. I love playing on my PS4 and Nintendo Switch. Some of my favorite games
          right now are Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Dragon Ball Fighterz, and Rocket League.
          Exercising at the gym is a great stress reliver for me. It allows me to vent out any struggles
          I may be having, while gaining more muscle mass for myself.
