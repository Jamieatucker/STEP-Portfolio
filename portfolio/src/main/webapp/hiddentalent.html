        <p>Can create music mashups!<br><br>The inspiration came to me from listening to hundreds of music mashups on
          YouTube. People were mashing vaporwave and hip hop together like it was peanut butter and  
          jelly. They were mashing video game soundtracks and pop songs together like mash 
          potatoes and gravy. I was entranced by the musical artistry.<br><br>I have a playlist of over 50 of my favorite music mashups. 
          I created my first music mashup in late September 2018. I spent weeks using 
          the program Audacity making sure it sounded as fluid as possible, with 
          little training going into it. It may not have sounded the best, but I was thrilled 
          to have created a mashup that I wanted, and had sounded coherent. The audio 
          file below contains one of my mashups, 
          called "Highest in the Woods Instrumental". Feel free to listen if you would like!
